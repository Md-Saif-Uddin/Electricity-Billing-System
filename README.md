I developed this desktop application using Java Swing GUI and for database i used mysql workbench.
Two types of user in this project admin and customer --> 
(1) Admin can add new customer and update monthly unit consumed by customer and generate bill. 
(2) Customer can signup and login , generate their bill , pay their bill (not actually paying just they can only open paytm website) or get billing details, can view and update their information, and exit;
